===================

Test Buster.js testing to help debug issues.

## [Bug #395](https://github.com/busterjs/buster/issues/395)
Expected: console should log `create extension` and `configure`

Extension is created and configured with `buster-test --node` and `buster-test --browser`.

`buster-static` does not execute the extension.
